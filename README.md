## Inspiration

The inspiration for the project in centered in the social context. 
This pandemic made all of us feel impotent and insecure, but the HackCovid and the Sivep Digital project gave us a way to contribuit with what we know to help in the best possible way in this context.


## What it Does
	
Sivep Digital is an app, initially for Desktop, where the health professionals will be able to fill the Sivep record, already updated for Sars-Cov-2. Besides that, Sivep Digital makes it possible and easier for data collection and processing, once it creates a database for the submited record.			

## How I Build It

The app was mainly created with Python programming language, using Tkinter library for the graphical interface and Sqlite3 for the database management. The statistical analyzes have been made using the Pandas library and  the graphics plots used the Matplotlib library. 
The group used Pycharm Community Edition and VSCode as code editors and the Github as remote repository.

## Challenges I ran into

The team is consisted of five physics students, wich means that interface programming is not usual for the group. Considering this, a great challange dealt was learn how to manage a graphic interface. Another great challenge was the learning of how to create and manage the SQLite3 library tools and SQL data bases.		

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
	
The team is most proud of the creative solutions that we have created in the process, and, of course, the help we provide to the health institutions and the health professionals in this pandemic context.

## What I Learned

All of us had learned a lot in the process, specially about the librarys and the data management.

## What's Next for Sivep Digital
	
The first thing that the team would like to implement is an automatic fill of the address fields with the CEP entry, in addition to the possibility of taking it to mobile devices. The program is quite versatile in this sense, since it is written in phyton, a language whose wealth of tools and versatility are massive.
